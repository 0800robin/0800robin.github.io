      <i>Bloom</i> is a WebXR experiment which lets you create a fractal tree garden in your world.

    <h2>Motivation üåç</h2>
    <p>
      It is 2021 buzzword-du-jour is metaverse. I want to explore what a calm, natural metaverse might feel like rather than a shopping center mixed with an office.
      It is the COP26 climate summit during the week of writing so I thought putting some virtual trees into the world via immersive web technology was somewhat fitting.
      I am keen to explore WebXR and this is a great way to get back up speed with three.js.
    </p>


    <h2>Approach üëΩ</h2>
      <p>
       I started off by making a simple fractal tree in Processing using 2D vectors + lines + velocity. Converting this over to 3D was a bit tricky but understanding that nesting the branches in the three.js scenegraph is akin to pushMatrix and popMatrix in Processing mad everything a little clearer.
      </p>
      <p>
A magic moment was realising that nesting the branches in the tree structure of the three.js scenegraph is the key to making trees in 3D, which is poetic, really.
