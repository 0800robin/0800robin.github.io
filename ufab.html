        I spent the summer of 2018 at Fjord Stockholm working as a front-end
        developer on uFab. We worked in an agile 8~ person SCRUM to design and
        deliver uFab in collaboration with a global team.

        My role was focused on implementing components in React, displaying 3D
        models in three.js, keeping things in check with Redux and a lot of CSS
        to extend the Ant Design component library. I thoroughly enjoyed being a
        bridge between the UI design and Engineering team.
