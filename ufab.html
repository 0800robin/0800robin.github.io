      <strong>uFab</strong> is powerful quoting platform which transforms the

    <h2>Project Overview ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª</h2>
    <p>uFab is a simple yet powerful quoting platform, that transforms the machining cost estimation
      with effective process planning, automatic machining plan generation & cross-shop collaboration opening up
      previously untapped business insights.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>I spent the summer of 2018 at Fjord Stockholm working as a front-end developer</u> on uFab. We worked on the web build
      in an agile <strong>8~ person SCRUM</strong> to design and deliver the project in collaboration with other 
      engineering across the globe.
    </p>
    <h2>My role ðŸ‘¾</h2>
    <p>I implemented new components in <u>React</u>, handled app state in <u>Redux</u>. We extended the Ant component library, so I worked
      on a lot of CSS and animations too. <u>I used three.js to create a way of visualising the machining plans in 3D</u>.</p>
    <p>
      As well as shipping code, I acted as a bridge between the design and engineering team. By bringing a design voice
      to the devs & a dev voice to the designers, we could work (mostly) in harmony to satisfy product requirements 
      through beautiful design in a way that was streamlined and healthy for the codebase.
