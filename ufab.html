      <strong>uFab</strong> is powerful quoting platform which transforms the

    <p>
      I spent the summer of 2018 at Fjord Stockholm 🇸🇪 working as a front-end
      developer on uFab. We worked in an agile
      <strong>8~ person SCRUM</strong> to design and deliver uFab in
      collaboration with a global team.
    </p>
    <p>
      My main role was implementing
      <strong>components in React</strong> and handling app state with
      <strong>Redux</strong>. I also worked on displaying 3D part models in
      <strong>three.js</strong> and extending the
      <strong>Ant Design</strong> component library. I thoroughly enjoyed
      being a bridge between the design and engineering team.
