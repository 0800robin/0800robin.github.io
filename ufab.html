    <p>
      I spent the summer of 2018 at Fjord Stockholm working as a front-end developer on uFab. We worked in an agile 8~
      person SCRUM to design and deliver uFab in collaboration with a global team.
    </p>
    <p>
      My role was focused on implementing components in React, displaying 3D models in three.js, keeping things in check
      with Redux and a lot of CSS to extend the Ant Design component library. I thoroughly enjoyed being a bridge
      between
      the UI design and Engineering team.
