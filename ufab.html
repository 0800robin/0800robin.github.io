    <h2>Project Overview ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.ufab.io/" target="blank">uFab</a> is a simple yet powerful quoting platform, that transforms the machining cost estimation
      with effective process planning, automatic machining plan generation & cross-shop collaboration opening up
      previously untapped business insights.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent the summer of 2018 at Fjord Stockholm working as a front-end developer on uFab. We worked on the web build
      in an agile 9~ person SCRUM team to design and deliver the project in collaboration with other 
      engineering teams across the globe.
    </p>
    <h2>My role ðŸ‘¾</h2>
    <p>I built components in React, implemented app state logic in Redux & helped extend the Ant component 
    library by writing a lot of CSS and animations. I implemented a way of visualising .obj files using three.js 
    to allow users to visualise the auto-generated machining plans within the tool.
    
    <p>
      As well as shipping code, I acted as a bridge between the design & engineering teams. By bringing a design voice
      to the devs & a dev voice to the designers, we could work (mostly) in harmony to satisfy product requirements 
      through beautiful design in a way that was streamlined and healthy for the codebase.
