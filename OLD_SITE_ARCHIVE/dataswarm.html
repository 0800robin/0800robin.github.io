      <i>DataSwarm</i> is an interactive art installation inspired by birds in the sky.

    <h2>The event ðŸ“…</h2>
    <p>
      Equinox is a yearly internal conference at Fjord, where we get together for 3 days of talks, conversation and fun.
      For Equinox 2019, we created an interactive visualisation of all attendees at the event called Dataswarm.
    </p>

    <p> We created a control panel interface which could change the behaviour of the swarm and left it out
      on an ipad for the conference attendees to play with. It was fun to see the swarm reflect the mood of the
      conference
      throughout the day, starting calmly, then getting a lot more lively as the day went on.
    </p>


    <h2>About the piece ðŸŽ¨</h2>
    <p>
      The swarm is a metaphor for the event: people come together and form small groups made up of people from
      across the globe who practice different crafts, they then split off naturally, joining other flocks and moving
      in new ways with new people. Together, we create and shape a main system which is larger and more complex than 
      any of the individuals within it.

    <h2>My role ðŸ‘¾</h2>
    <p>
      I initiated and lead the project with the support of two creative technologists and one visual
      designer. We used
      p5.js to implement the classic <a href="https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/" target="_blank">Boids</a>
      algorithm.
      Firebase was used to add real time control. We implemented a bin-lattice spatial subdivision
      approach to ensure performance at 400+ boids on a large screen.
