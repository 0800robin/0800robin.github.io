			<strong>Ocean</strong> is a fun and simple way to make music with
			friends using just your web browser. <a href="https://www.oceanwaves.io"
				target="blank">https://www.oceanwaves.io</a>
		</h4>

		<p>
			During my post-graduate year at Goldsmiths I researched how people work
			collaborate online. I explored how different roles naturally emerge when
			working remotely together & the technical and UX approaches to
			successfully design systems which fun, engaging web based collaboration.
		</p>

		<p>
			Ocean has been iterated on many times over a number of years as a
			beloved personal project. I am the sole developer & work in
			collaboration with two friends who work in music community & UX design. Our aim is to build a fun and simple way
			to make music and break down the barriers associated with electronic music production.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>
				During the 2020 lockdown, Ocean has attracted a global user base, from
				Wuhan to Damascus. During a time where friends and normal life feel
				very distant, seeing other people expressing themselves & being 'along
				together' using a tool i've created has been incredibly rewarding.
			</strong>
		</p>

		<p>I'd love to talk more one to one about how Ocean was built, where its heading and the state of audio on the web!
