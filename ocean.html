			<strong>Ocean</strong> is a fun and simple way to make music with
			friends using just your web browser. <a href="https://www.oceanwaves.io"

		</h4>

		<p>
			During my post-graduate year at Goldsmiths <strong>I researched how people
				remotely collaborate on creative projects online</strong>. I explored how different roles naturally emerge when
			working remotely together & the technical and UX approaches to
			successfully design systems which fun, engasging web based collaboration. Ocean is the result of multiple
			iterations over a number of years after my initial research.</p>


		<p>
			The aim of Ocean is to build an accessible simple way to make music and <strong>break down the barriers associated
				with electronic music production.</strong> I am the sole
			developer & work in collaboration with two friends who work in music community & UX design.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>The three core design principles</strong> for Ocean are: Fun, Fast, Simple. The
			use of playful visual language, and as little written text as possible allows Ocean to be used by as many people
			as possible.
		</p>


		<p>
			Users can explore the curated sound library, made up of Creative Commons sounds and drag and drop them into their
			project. After building some beat patterns, they can then arrange patterns into a longer track and post to their
			profile to share with friends.

			<strong>
				During the 2020 lockdown, Ocean has attracted a global user base, from
				Wuhan to Damascus. During a time where friends and normal life feel
				very distant, seeing other people expressing themselves & being 'along
				together' using a tool i've created has been incredibly rewarding.
			</strong>

		<p>I'd love to talk more one to one about how Ocean was built, where its heading and the state of audio on the web!
