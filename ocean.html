			<h2>UPDATE: 2020 Lockdown</h2>
			<p class="madness">
				<strong>
					Throughout the 2020 lockdown Ocean has grown a global base of 1000+ members & has facilitated world wide jam
					sessions from all corners of the earth. During a time where friends and normal life
					feel distant, seeing people expressing themselves & being 'along together' using a tool i've created
					has been incredibly rewarding.
				</strong>

			<h2>Project Overview üó∫</h2>
			<p>
				<u>My MSci research at Goldsmiths¬†explored how people collaborative make music remotely.</u> I researched how
				different technical and experience design approaches can enable successful web-based remote music making.
			</p>
			<p>
				I created a series of prototypes and workshops & found that roles naturally emerge when people jam together
				remotely and people have more fun when creating together.
			</p>

			<p>Ocean has been iterated over the last few years since graduating as a beloved side project. I collaborate
				with two friends (who work in design & music) to design new features and market the platform.
			</p>

			<h2>Who Why How üë©‚ÄçüöÄ</h2>
			<p><u>Ocean is aimed at people who are just starting out making music</u>. Our primary research found that
				beginners
				find DAWs overwhelming & some people are locked out by the high price tags they often come with. We also
				understand that <u>short, fast self-expression</u> is the fundamental way young people express themselves
				online.
			</p>
			<p><u>Taking what we know about the User, we can leverage the magic of modern Browsers & web apps</u>.
				The Web Audio API provide a solid base to explore really cool Audio projects on the web & tone.js helps get
				things
				moving quickly. This new lease of creative life on the web creates a perfect storm for projects like Ocean. </p>
			<p>
				The aim of Ocean is to build an accessible simple way to make music and <u>break down the barriers associated
					with electronic music production.</u>
			</p>

			<h1>Design üïπ</h1>
			<p>
				<u>Fun, Fast & Simple</u> are Ocean's core design principles. We focus on emoji & minimal text to allow
				Ocean to be used by as many people as possible. Otherwise complex digital music concepts, such as time
				stretching, are boiled down to simple and fun controls.
			</p>

			<h2>Built for collaboration</h2>
			<p>The main session view is straight to business, focusing on the main sequencer. Friends are added to the session
				simply by sharing the project URL and all changes to the session are synced and saved in real time.</p>

			<h2>Arrange & Share</h2>
			<p>After building some beat patterns, they can then arrange patterns into a longer track and post to their
				profile to share with friends.</p>

			<h2>What's next? üöÄ</h2>
			<p>We're now prototyping a new set of social and musical features for Ocean with our most engaged early users &
				launching a series of collaborations with a range of other brilliant music groups/charities/projects.
			</p>

			<p>Stay tuned for more updates ü§ñ</p>
