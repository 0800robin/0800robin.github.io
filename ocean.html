    <h2>A fun and simple way to make music with friends using just your web browser.</h2>

    <p>This project is an exploration into interaction & technological approaches to music making and how the web as a
      platform is evolving into a powerful medium for creative, interactive apps.</p>
    <p>During my post-graduate research at Goldsmiths i explored how people work together on the web, the roles that
      emerge
      and the UX and technological considerations that promote fun remote collaboration.</p>
