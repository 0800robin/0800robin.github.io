    <h2>Project Overview üöÄ</h2>
    <p>
      In 2019, Fjord, Intel & <a href="https://www.scottmorganfoundation.org/" target="_blank">The Scott-Morgan Foundation</a> redesigned ACAT, an assistive toolkit for 
      MND patients, originally created for Stephen Hawking. This project aimed to allow sufferers to retain those 
      most human of traits: communication and personality, by leveraging the bleeding edge technologies like 
      speech-bank based voice synthesis, AI predictive text and 3D avatars.
    </p>

    <p>We worked closely with super-scientist <a href="https://www.scott-morgan.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Peter Scott-Morgan</a>, who was diagnosed with MND in 2017. Peter is 
      harnessing technology to help him ‚Äì and other people with extreme disabilities ‚Äì live an enhanced life.</p>

<h2>My Role ‚å®Ô∏è</h2>
        <p>
      I worked as part of a small cross-disciplinary team over five months.
      I co-facilited research sessions at Peters home & with the brilliant team of speech therapists and carers at Royal
      Hospital for Neuro-Disability in Putney.
      I was responsible for prototyping and testing new circular keyboard designs with Peter.
      I implemented a series of new features into ACAT, such as an emergency alarm and easy access name book.
