    <h1>
      <strong>Peter 2.0</strong> is the extraordinary journey of super-scientist Peter Scott-Morgan, as he turns himself
      into a cyborg in an attempt to overcome the Motor Neurone Disease (MND).
    </h1>

    <p>
      Assistive Context-Aware Toolkit (ACAT) is an open source platform
      enabling people with motor-neurone disease to have full access to the
      capabilities of their computers through very constrained interfaces. The
      open source system was originally developed for and used by Stephen
      Hawking.
    </p>

        <p class="madness">
      We worked, tested and ideated ACAT 2.0 with
      <a href="http://www.scott-morgan.com/blog/" about="_blank">Peter Scott-Morgan</a>, an English-American roboticist
      who is leveraging new technology in
      order to THRIVE with MND.¬†We worked to a very tight deadline to ensure
      Peter could use the software after scheduled Layrectomy surgery. We
      shipped on time and
      <u>Peter uses ACAT 2.0 as his primary means of communication.</u>
    </p>

    <hr/>
    <p>
      In 2019, Fjord and Intel Labs partnered to design & develop a new
      interface for ACAT. We wanted to explore and implement eye-tracking to
      enable quicker typing and ease of navigating around the interface, which
      previously used a timed, looping menu selection interaction pattern
      actuated by computer vision or micro-movement sensors.
    </p>

    <p class="madness">
      I worked as part of a
      <u> small cross-disciplinary team </u> over four months.
      <u>I was responsible for rapidly prototyping a new circular keyboard
        design.</u>
      These prototypes were used to consistently test and refine our ideas
      through research, testing and ideation¬†sessions with a od variety
      subject matter experts across voice modelling, avatar creation, text
      recommendation & eye interaction.
    </p>

    <p>
      As the project progressed,
      <u>I was responsible for¬†implementing the final designs of the circular
        keyboard UI and UX components</u>
      as well as a set of useful new features.
      <u>I worked as the bridge between UI / UX designers and software
        engineers</u>
      to ensure we could implement our new features into the legacy WinForms
      .NET codebase reliably, while retaining our fundamental design
      approaches. It was vital to ensure rapid sentence creation was possible
      with minimal eye-strain and of course implementing a clean, attractive
      interface design suitable for all-day use.
