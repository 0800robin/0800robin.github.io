        <strong>ACAT 2.0</strong> explores how eye-tracking can be used to give
        MND patients a faster way to communicate.
      </h4>
      <p>
        Assistive Context-Aware Toolkit (ACAT) is an open source platform
        enabling people with motor neuron diseases to have full access to the
        capabilities of their computers through very constrained interfaces. In
        late 2019, Fjord and Intel Labs partnered to design and develop a new,
        eye-tracking enabled interface for ACAT, an assistive technology system
        originally developed for Stephen Hawking.

        We designed and implemented a novel spherical keyboard design and a
        variety of useful new features based on our design research approach. I
        worked with a cross-disciplinary design and development team spread
        across the US and UK & my focus was ideating & implementing the new
        UI/UX designs.

        We tested ACAT 2.0 with

        communicating with the world and
