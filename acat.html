    <h2>Assistive Context-Aware Toolkit (ACAT) is an open source platform enabling people with motor neuron diseases to
      have full access to the capabilities of their computers through very constrained interfaces.</h2>

    <p>In late 2019, Fjord and Intel partnered to design and develop a new, eye-tracking enabled interface for ACAT. We
      worked closely to test them with <a href="http://www.scott-morgan.com/blog/" about="_blank">Peter
        Scott-Morgan</a>, an English-American roboticist leveraging new technology in order to THRIVE with MND.<a

    <p>We designed and implemented a novel spherical keyboard design and a variety of useful new features based on our
      design research approach. I worked with a cross-disciplinary design and development team spread across the US and
      UK & my focus was ideating & implementing the new UI/UX designs. Peter is now using this version of ACAT as his
      way of communicating with the world. </p>
