      <h4>
        <strong>ACAT 2.0</strong> explores how eye-tracking can be used to give
        MND patients a faster way to communicate.
      </h4>
      <p>
        Assistive Context-Aware Toolkit (ACAT) is an open source platform
        enabling people with motor neuron diseases to have full access to the
        capabilities of their computers through very constrained interfaces. In
        late 2019, Fjord and Intel Labs partnered to design and develop a new,
        eye-tracking enabled interface for ACAT, an assistive technology system
        originally developed for Stephen Hawking.
      </p>

      <p>
        We designed and implemented a
        <strong>novel spherical keyboard design</strong> and a set of useful new
        features such as
        <strong>alarms, phrasebooks and shortcuts</strong> based on our embedded
        research approach. We worked with a cross-disciplinary design, including
        linguistic experts, AI researchers and development teams spread across
        the US and UK. I was responsible for
        <strong>implementing the new UI/UX designs</strong> into the legacy
        codebase and
        <strong>co-facilitating research, testing and ideation</strong> sessions
        throughout the project.
      </p>

      <p>
        We tested ACAT 2.0 with
