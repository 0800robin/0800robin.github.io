      <h4>
        <strong>ACAT 2.0</strong> explores how eye-tracking can be used to give
        MND patients a faster way to communicate.
      </h4>

      <p>
        Assistive Context-Aware Toolkit (ACAT) is an open source platform
        enabling people with motor-neurone disease to have full access to the
        capabilities of their computers through very constrained interfaces. The
        open source system was originally developed for and used by Stephen
        Hawking.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2019, Fjord and Intel Labs partnered to design & develop a new
        interface for ACAT. We wanted to explore and implement eye-tracking to
        enable quicker typing and ease of navigating around the interface, which
        previously used a timed, looping menu selection interaction pattern
        actuated by computer vision or micro-movement sensors.

      <p>
        I worked as part of a
        <strong> small cross-disciplinary team </strong> over four months.
        <strong
          >I was responsible for rapidly prototyping a new circular keyboard
          design.</strong
        >
        These prototypes were used to consistently test and refine our ideas
        through research, testing and ideation¬†sessions with a od variety
        subject matter experts across voice modelling, avatar creation, text
        recommendation & eye interaction.

        As the project progressed,
        <strong
          >I was responsible for¬†implementing the final designs of the circular
          keyboard UI and UX components</strong
        >
        as well as a set of useful new features.
        <strong
          >I worked as the bridge between UI / UX designers and software
          engineers</strong
        >
        to ensure we could implement our new features into the legacy WinForms
        .NET codebase reliably, while retaining our fundamental design
        approaches. It was vital to ensure rapid sentence creation was possible
        with minimal eye-strain and of course implementing a clean, attractive
        interface design suitable for all-day use.

        order to THRIVE with MND.¬†We worked to a very tight deadline to ensure
        Peter could use the software after scheduled Layrectomy surgery. We
        shipped on time and
