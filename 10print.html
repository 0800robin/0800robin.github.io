      <i>Adventures In 10 Print</i> is an interactive generative artwork & e-gallery exploring the theme of 'Chance and
      Control'.
    </h1>


    <h2>Overview üåç</h2>
    <p>
      In September 2020, I was commissioned to explore the theme of 'Chance And Control' by the V&A and 
      <a href="http://www.chestervisualarts.org.uk">Chester Visual Arts</a>. I built 
      <a href="http://www.chestervisualarts.org.uk/10print/" target="_blank">Adventures In 10 Print</a>, an interactive 
      website which enables people of all technical abilities to play with a classic computer art algorithm & share 
      what they create in a public gallery.
    </p>


    <h2>About the work üé®</h2>
    <p>The <a href="https://10print.org/"  target="_blank">10 Print algorithm</a> is the essence of 'Chance and Control'. 
    The sequence of computer-generated randomness used to draw the sequence has a near 0% chance of ever 
    repeating in that order again. So each time it runs, it produces an entirely new pattern, but retains a fundamental 
    set of aesthetic characteristics the viewer can control.
    </p>

    <p>
      The browser window itself acts as both the medium of creation and display, which presents an interesting dynamic.      
      I hope to remind the viewer that the internet can still (sometimes) be a fun and playful place by re-appropriating 
      the idea of a 'website' to serve purely artistic ends.
