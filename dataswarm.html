      <strong>DataSwarm</strong> An interactive data visualisation inspired by birds in the sky.
    </h1>

    <p>
      Equinox is yearly internal conference at Fjord, where we get together for 3 days of talks, conversation and fun.
      At Equinox 2019, we installed Dataswarm, an interactive visualisation of all attendees at the event.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>I initiated and lead the project</strong> with the support of two creative technologists and one visual
      designer. We used
      <strong>p5.js</strong> to implement the classic <a href="https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/"
        target="_blank">Boids</a> algorithm.
      <strong>Firebase</strong> was used to add real time control. We implemented a bin-lattice spatial subdivision
      approach to ensure a performance at 400+ boids.
    </p>

    <p class="madness">
      The swarm acts as a metaphor for the event: people come together and form small groups made up of people from
      different locations who practice different crafts, they then split off naturally, joining other flocks and moving
      in new ways with new people, while being part of a main system larger than our individual selves.
    </p>

    <p> We left the control ipad to the conference attendees, so they could alter the
      behaviour of the swarm throughout the day.</p>
