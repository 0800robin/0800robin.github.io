      <strong>DataSwarm</strong> is an interactive data swarm visualisation inspired by birds in the sky.
    </h1>

    <h2>The event üìÖ</h2>
    <p>
      Equinox is yearly internal conference at Fjord, where we get together for 3 days of talks, conversation and fun.
      For Equinox 2019, we created an interactive visualisation of all attendees at the event called Dataswarm.
    </p>

    <p class="madness">
      The swarm acts as a metaphor for the event: people come together and form small groups made up of people from
      different locations who practice different crafts, they then split off naturally, joining other flocks and moving
      in new ways with new people, while being part of a main system larger than our individual selves.
    </p>




    <h2>My role üëæ</h2>
    <p>
      <u>I initiated and lead the project</u> with the support of two creative technologists and one visual
      designer. We used
      <u>p5.js</u> to implement the classic <a href="https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/" target="_blank">Boids</a>
      algorithm.
      <u>Firebase</u> was used to add real time control. We implemented a bin-lattice spatial subdivision
      approach to ensure a performance at 400+ boids.

    <h2>Reception üëç</h2>
    <p>We created a control panel interface which could change the behaviour of the swarm and we left it out
      on an ipad for the conference attendees to play with. It was fun to see the swarm reflect the mood of the
      conference
      throughout the day, starting calmly, then getting a lot more lively as the day went on.

    <p>The massive screen we ran it on also acted as a cool meeting point for people.</p>
