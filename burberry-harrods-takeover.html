          For Burberry's takeover of Harrods in 2024, the Creative Tech team
          were tasked with creating an in-store interactive experience and a way
          of bringing the collaboration to life for people who couldn't access
          the physical location. We produced an AI photobooth for customers to
          take branded selfies on in Harrods. We also used our extensive
          knowledge and prototypes of always-on-gaming platforms to collaborate
          with a 3rd party on the creation of a branded Burberry x Harrods world
          on Roblox.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold"
            >I led the development of the photobooth experience</span
          >
          from prototyping through to live deployment, focusing on reliability,
          speed, and polish under real-world conditions.. Using real-time AI
          background AIsegmentation, the booth allowed customers to take selfies
          on a Burberry Harrods Check pattern background. 4 images were
          transformed into looping GIFs and emailed to the customer. The
          experience was a hit ‚Äî a blend of fun accessible luxury experience and
          data capture. We drove over<span class="font-bold"
            >5,000 new leads into Burberry‚Äôs CRM</span
          >
          in under a month.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          Technically, the installation required
          <span class="font-bold"
            >tight integration with the visual merchandising (VM) setup at
            Harrods</span
          >
          We had some issues with static electricity and the complexities of
          integrating modern tech into a 175+ year old store. These were
          overcome by working closely with the install team to ensure
          everything‚Äîfrom camera positioning to lighting to the UX‚Äîwas
          production-ready and frictionless for customers.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          In parallel,
          <span class="font-bold"
            >I led a series of creative tech prototypes exploring persistent
            gaming platforms</span
          >
          like The Sims, UEFN, and Roblox Studio. These internal experiments
          helped lay the groundwork for Burberry‚Äôs broader gaming strategy and
          contributed to the concept behind the Roblox Harrods experience, which
          was developed by Sawhorse. Together, these projects show how creative
          technology can deliver both short term impact (customer lead sign ups)
          and long-term brand strategy (next generation customer education via
          gaming).
