        <p class="mb-4">
          Peter 2.0 was, by some distance, the most extraordinary project I‚Äôve
          ever had the privilege to contribute to. Dr Peter Scott-Morgan, a man
          with a PhD in robotics and true British eccentric, was diagnosed with
          motor neurone disease in 2017. He spent the rest of his life turning
          himself into, in his own words, Peter 2.0, The Human Cyborg. With his
          irresistible charm, he rallied experts and collaborators including
          Fjord, Intel, and Rolls Royce to help bring his visionto life.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold"
            >My role on the project was to prototype new accessibility
            capabilities and test them with Peter.</span
          >
          I worked in an interdisciplinary team of designers, speech therapists,
          docters and hardware experts. We spent time living with Peter,
          learning how he used his computer, the tasks he needed to accomplish
          daily, and what communication meant to him. We spoke with his husband,
          carers, and family to get a deeper understanding of who he was.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          I then worked closely with the Intel Labs team and
          <span class="font-bold">implemented key new features into ACAT</span>,
          the open-source accessibility tech suite originally built for Stephen
          Hawking.

          <li class="mb-4">
            <span class="font-bold">Spherical Eye-Controlled Keyboard:</span> We
            redesigned the standard QWERTY layout into a novel spherical
            keyboard, which reduced eye muscle strain. I then integrated an
            off-the-shelf gaming eye-controller into the ACAT platform using C#
            and custom Windows libraries.
          </li>

              >Personality-Preserving Text To Speech:</span
            >
            I iterated on the ACAT auto-complete tool, taking phrases from
            Peters's books and conversation recordings to hyper personalise the
            language in the auto complete, so he could access his unique wit and
            turns of phrase quickly.

            captured his true essence.

          Reflecations in 2025: Peter predicted personalised LLMs!
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          This project took place in 2017 and i remember reading about early
          outputs from OpenAI's GPT. I am proud of what we achieved for Peter at
          the time, but of course this new dawn of LLMs means
          personality-preserving custom text generation has new truly arrived
          and can supercharge projects like this. It is testament to Peter's
          brilliant mind that even in 2017 he had essentially described a desire
          for a personalised AI agent, which has really come to reality mid way
          though the 2020s with Gemini, ChatGPT et al.

          As his condition progressed, this system became his connection to the
          world, giving him ability to communicate. but something far more

          remember for the rest of my life. As his condition progressed, this

          It was a testament to how technology, when designed with deep empathy,
          can preserve the very core of our humanity."
