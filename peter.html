          Peter 2.0 was, by some distance, the most extraordinary project I‚Äôve
          ever had the privilege to contribute to. Dr Peter Scott-Morgan, a man
          with a PhD in robotics and true British eccentric, was diagnosed with
          motor neurone disease in 2017. He spent the rest of his life turning
          himself into, in his own words, Peter 2.0, The Human Cyborg. With his
          irresistible charm, he rallied experts and collaborators including
          Fjord, Intel, and Rolls Royce to help bring his visionto life.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          My role on the project was to work closely with the Intel Labs team to
          build out new features into ACAT, the open-source accessibility tech
          suite originally built for Stephen Hawking. We spent time living with
          Peter, learning how he used his computer, the tasks he needed to
          accomplish daily, and what communication meant to him. We spoke with
          his husband, carers, and family to get a deeper understanding of who
          he was.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          I worked as part of an interdisciplinary team of speech therapists,
          doctors, UX designers, hardware experts and beyond. We redesigned the
          standard QWERTY keyboard with a spherical eye-controlled keyboard.
          This design reduced strain across the eye muscles and better suited
          his needs. I used an off-the-shelf gaming eye-controller and weaved
          this into ACAT with C# libraries and Windows.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Alongside this, we explored the retention of personality and
          spontaneity in digital communication, experimenting with early LLMs
          (large language models). This project took place just as ChatGPT was
          emerging.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          Using Peter‚Äôs books, turns of phrase, and wit, we built an
          autocomplete model that could ‚Äújam‚Äù with him in real time‚Äîsurfacing
          his quirks and language patterns as he typed. This was paired with a
          voice clone trained on his speech and a hyper-realistic MetaHuman
          render of his face, allowing Peter to interact through a fully
          responsive, eye-controlled interface. As his condition progressed,
          this system preserved not just his ability to communicate, but
          something far more powerful‚Äîhis essence. It was a profound, moving
          experience I‚Äôll remember for the rest of my life.
